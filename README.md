# Spotify Music Recommendation System ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¸

Hey there music lovers! Check out my cool Spotify Music Recommendation System that I built. This Recommendation system uses **content-based filtering** and **cosine similarity** to recommend the songs that match your preferences. It uses Artist names, Album name, Loudness, Tempo and other musical fetaures to find similarities between different tracks. Give it a spin and let the music adventure begin! ðŸŽµðŸ”¥


To use the streamlit based web app, where I deployed my model :-

```
pyhton -m streamlit run music_recommender.py
```
